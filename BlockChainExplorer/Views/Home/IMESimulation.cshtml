<h2>@ViewBag.Title.</h2>

<p>The currency unit of the Agrikore blockchain is the MULA. MULA will be purchaseable from local currency with the Tingg App as the blockchain solution gets rolled out into each community.
    The MULA is a reserved back currency at the outset which means any MULAs issued is backed by about the same amount of local currency exchanged for it in value.
    At the onset, Cellulant will inject liquidity directly into the reserve in exchange for any MULAs issued. Cellulant will also allow members of the public who wish to hold MULAs in order to participate in the future growth of this ecosystem or in support of its benefit to agricultural communities served by the ecosysytem, to purchase MULAs in exchange for ETH at the onset. Much of the MULA purchased in this initial MULA offering is retained in the reserves such that like any currency, purhasers may exchange it back for nearly their same purchase value, or greater value depending on the exchange rate appreciation of the MULA. </p>
<p>The process of purchasing initial MULAs at the start is simulated from this page.</p>
